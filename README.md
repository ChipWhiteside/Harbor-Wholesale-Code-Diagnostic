# Harbor Wholesale Code Diagnostic
Description: \n
A simple web application, created based off of a design given by Harbor, to showcase my skills and abilities in web development.\n
\n
About: \n
Project is a Standalone TypeScript Angular Project, created using the Visual Studio template. \n
Languages utilized are (mainly) TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.\n
Project includes a small local json server utilized for the saving and reading of saved contact information. In an actual application the submitted contact data would be saved to a permanent server but for the scope of this project, the json server sufficed. \n
Some creative liberties were taken with the designing of the UI/UX although main feel and functionality aligned directly with the provided design.\n
\n
Instructions:\n
To start project:\n
Path to directory: '../Harbor-Wholesale-Code-Diagnostic/ChipWhiteside_HarborCodeDiagnostic'\n

    (This sets the project to run on localhost:4200)\n
Run command: 'npm run server' \n
    (This sets the local json server to run on localhost:5000, you can alter the port the server runs on by altering line 10 of package.json is root folder)\n
