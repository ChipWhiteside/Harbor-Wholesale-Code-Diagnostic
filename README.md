# Harbor Wholesale Code Diagnostic
Description:
A simple web application, created based off of a design given by Harbor, to showcase my skills and abilities in web development.

About: 
Project is a Standalone TypeScript Angular Project, created using the Visual Studio template. 
Languages utilized are (mainly) TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
Project includes a small local json server utilized for the saving and reading of saved contact information. In an actual application the submitted contact data would be saved to a permanent server but for the scope of this project, the json server sufficed. 
Some creative liberties were taken with the designing of the UI/UX although main feel and functionality aligned directly with the provided design.

Instructions:
To start project:
Path to directory: '../Harbor-Wholesale-Code-Diagnostic/ChipWhiteside_HarborCodeDiagnostic'
Run command: 'ng serve' 
    (This sets the project to run on localhost:4200)
Run command: 'npm run server' 
    (This sets the local json server to run on localhost:5000, you can alter the port the server runs on by altering line 10 of package.json is root folder)
