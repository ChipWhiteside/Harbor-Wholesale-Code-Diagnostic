# Harbor Wholesale Code Diagnostic
Description: <br />
A simple web application, created based off of a design given by Harbor, to showcase my skills and abilities in web development.<br />
<br />
About: <br />
Project is a Standalone TypeScript Angular Project, created using the Visual Studio template. <br />
Languages utilized are (mainly) TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.<br />
Project includes a small local json server utilized for the saving and reading of saved contact information. In an actual application the submitted contact data would be saved to a permanent server but for the scope of this project, the json server sufficed. <br />
Some creative liberties were taken with the designing of the UI/UX although main feel and functionality aligned directly with the provided design.<br />
<br />
Instructions:<br />
To start project:<br />
Path to directory: '../Harbor-Wholesale-Code-Diagnostic/ChipWhiteside_HarborCodeDiagnostic'<br />
Run command: 'ng serve' <br />
    (This runs the project on localhost:4200)<br />
Run command: 'npm run server' <br />
    (This sets the local json server to run on localhost:5000, you can alter the port the server runs on by altering line 10 of package.json is root folder)<br />
    You can navigate to 'http://localhost:5000/contact' in your browser to see the json server's contents
